Version Control
---------------
	Version control refers to a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time called the ‘versions’.
	In other words, these versions will help you in tracking the changes in your codes/project and if necessary, undo those changes as well.
	This feature of being able to compare, differentiate and revert changes between two versions of a particular project becomes really helpful when working on a larger project.
	Larger projects mean more people working on the same code which increases the chances of conflicts. 
	Using version control you can easily prevent these conflicts.
